# NEAT_GDScript
A better NEAT implementation from my old one, transtaled from Code Bullet's Processing implementation.

To utilize this, extend the NN_Population and NN_Agent, give them your own class_name and replace the functions provided in the example, inside My_Population and My_Agent.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on my Discord: https://discord.gg/SdNpD2FKrR

Thanks to zwometer for supporting the project.
